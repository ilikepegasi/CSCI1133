#Problem A: Grayscale
def grayscale(img_matrix):
    '''
    Purpose:
      Creates a grayscale version of an image matrix.
    Parameter(s):
      A 3D matrix (list of lists of lists) representing an .bmp image
      Each element of the matrix represents one row of pixels in the image
      Each element of a row represents a single pixel in the image
      Each pixel is represented by a list of three numbers between 0 and 255
      in the order [red, green, blue]
    Return Value:
      A 3D matrix of the same dimensions, with each pixel set to grayscale
      (that is, each color component set to the average of the three in
      the original pixel, rounded down to the nearest integer)

    Purpose:
      Inverts the color of an image
    Parameter(s):

    Return Value:
      A 3D matrix of the same dimensions, with red and blue values swapped
